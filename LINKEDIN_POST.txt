Excited to share my latest database design project! 🗄️

I've designed and implemented a comprehensive relational database for an e-commerce platform, demonstrating SQL intermediate-level skills (HackerRank certified).

Key Highlights:
✅ 11 normalized tables with complex relationships
✅ Automated business logic via triggers & stored procedures  
✅ Performance optimization with strategic indexing
✅ Complete documentation with ER diagrams

This project showcases my expertise in database design, normalization, and SQL optimization.
